# Tutorial: Build a Multi-Cluster Application seamlessly with ClusterResourcePropagation and Multi-Cluster Networking APIs

This tutorial will guide you through the process of building a multi-cluster application using the ClusterResourcePropagation and Multi-Cluster networking APIs.

It will start with a single cluster running a set of application resources which are placed by the ClusterResourcePropagation API and override API.
The application traffic will be exposed via Azure Traffic Manager by using the fleet networking APIs.
When another cluster joins, the clusterResourcePropagation will propagate the workloads to the new cluster. 
The traffic will be automatically split between the clusters and failover to the healthy cluster when one of the clusters is unhealthy.

## Scenario
Your fleet consists of the following clusters:

1. Member Cluster 1 with label "cluster-name: member-1"

You have a set of application resources running on Member Cluster 1 and you want to serve the traffic from a new cluster, Member Cluster 2.

## Current Application Resources

![](before.png)

The following resources are currently deployed in the hub cluster and use clusterResourcePlacement API to place them to the Member Cluster 1:

### Service
> Note: Service test file located [here](./testfiles/nginx-service.yaml).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
  namespace: multi-cluster-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
---
apiVersion: networking.fleet.azure.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceExport
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
  namespace: multi-cluster-app
```
The service is exposed using public IP and assigned a DNS name using [ro-nginx-service.yaml](./testfiles/ro-nginx-service.yaml)
and is visible to the fleet by creating ServiceExport.

```yaml
apiVersion: placement.kubernetes-fleet.io/v1alpha1
kind: ResourceOverride
metadata:
  name: ro-nginx-service
  namespace: multi-cluster-app
spec:
  resourceSelectors:
    -  group: ""
       kind: Service
       version: v1
       name: nginx-service
  policy:
    overrideRules:
      - clusterSelector:
          clusterSelectorTerms:
            - labelSelector:
                matchLabels:
                  cluster-name: member-1
        jsonPatchOverrides:
          - op: add
            path: /metadata/annotations
            value:
              {"service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name":"fleet-multi-cluster-app-member-1"}
```
Summary:
- This defines a Kubernetes Service named `nginx-service` in the `test-app` namespace.
- The service is of type LoadBalancer with a public ip address and a DNS name assigned.
- It targets pods with the label app: nginx and forwards traffic to port 80 on the pods.

#### Deployment

> Note: Deployment test file located [here](./testfiles/envelop-object.yaml).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: envelope-configmap
  namespace: multi-cluster-app
  annotations:
    kubernetes-fleet.io/envelope-configmap: "true"
data:
  nginx-deployment.yaml: |
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: nginx-deployment
      namespace: test-app
    spec:
      replicas: 2
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: nginx
              image: nginx:1.16.1
              ports:
               - containerPort: 80
```
> Note: The current deployment has 2 replicas.

Summary:
- This defines a Kubernetes Deployment named `nginx-deployment` in the `test-app` namespace using envelop object wrapper, so that
  it won't create workloads in the hub cluster.
- It creates 2 replicas of the nginx pod, each running the `nginx:1.16.1` image.
- The deployment ensures that the specified number of pods (replicas) are running and available.
- The pods are labeled with `app: nginx` and expose port 80.

#### ClusterResourcePlacement

> Note: CRP Availability test file located [here](./testfiles/crp-multi-cluster-app.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: placement.kubernetes-fleet.io/v1
kind: ClusterResourcePlacement
metadata:
  name: crp-availability
spec:
  resourceSelectors:
    - group: ""
      kind: Namespace
      name: test-app
      version: v1
  policy:
    placementType: PickAll
```

Summary:
- This defines a ClusterResourcePlacement named `crp-availability`.
- The placement policy selects all the existing cluster, member-1.
- It targets resources in the `test-app` namespace.

### TrafficManagerProfile

To expose the service via Traffic Manager, you need to create a trafficManagerProfile resource in the `test-app` namespace.

> Note: Profile test file located [here](./testfiles/nginx-profile.yaml) and please make sure the profile name (be part of the DNS name) is global unique.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.fleet.azure.com/v1alpha1
kind: TrafficManagerProfile
metadata:
  name: nginx-profile
  namespace: multi-cluster-app
spec:
  monitorConfig:
    port: 80
```
Summary:
- This defines a Traffic Manager Profile named `nginx-profile` in the `test-app` namespace.
- It listens on the specified port (80) for health checks.

```bash
kubectl get tmp -n multi-cluster-app
NAME            DNS-NAME                                             IS-PROGRAMMED   AGE
nginx-profile   multi-cluster-app-nginx-profile.trafficmanager.net   True            60s
```

### Exposing the Service as a Traffic Manager Endpoint

> Note:  nginx-backend file located [here](./testfiles/nginx-backend.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.fleet.azure.com/v1alpha1
kind: TrafficManagerBackend
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {"apiVersion":"networking.fleet.azure.com/v1alpha1","kind":"TrafficManagerBackend","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"nginx-backend","namespace":"multi-cluster-app"},"spec":{"backend":{"name":"nginx-service"},"profile":{"name":"nginx-profile"},"weight":100}}
  creationTimestamp: "2024-11-25T08:49:09Z"
  finalizers:
    - networking.fleet.azure.com/traffic-manager-backend-cleanup
  generation: 1
  name: nginx-backend
  namespace: multi-cluster-app
  resourceVersion: "3715151"
  uid: 90089f42-222a-4d9a-8a97-8b5ed2f9ca42
spec:

  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2024-11-25T08:53:30Z"
      message: 1 service(s) exported from clusters have been accepted as Traffic Manager
        endpoints
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Accepted
      status: "True"
      type: Accepted
  endpoints:

      target: fleet-multi-cluster-app-member-1.westcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com
      weight: 100
```
Summary:
- It defines a Traffic Manager Backend named `nginx-backend` in the `test-app` namespace.
- The weight is set to 100, which means all traffic is routed to this backend.

## Spreading the Application to Member Cluster 2

![](after.png)

### Update the ResourceOverride of the Service

To spread the application to Member Cluster 2, you need to expose the service as an Azure Traffic Manager endpoint by assigning a DNS label in the service.

> Note: Service test file located [here](./testfiles/ro-nginx-service.yaml).
> 
```yaml
apiVersion: placement.kubernetes-fleet.io/v1alpha1
kind: ResourceOverride
metadata:
  name: ro-nginx-service
  namespace: multi-cluster-app
spec:
  resourceSelectors:
    -  group: ""
       kind: Service
       version: v1
       name: nginx-service
  policy:
    overrideRules:
      - clusterSelector:
          clusterSelectorTerms:
            - labelSelector:
                matchLabels:
                  cluster-name: member-1
        jsonPatchOverrides:
          - op: add
            path: /metadata/annotations
            value:
              {"service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name":"fleet-multi-cluster-app-member-1"}
      - clusterSelector:
          clusterSelectorTerms:
            - labelSelector:
                matchLabels:
                  cluster-name: member-2
        jsonPatchOverrides:
          - op: add
            path: /metadata/annotations
            value:
              { "service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name": "fleet-multi-cluster-app-member-2" }

```

### Join Member Cluster 2 to the Fleet

you need to add the new cluster Member Cluster 2 with label "cluster-name: member-2"
as part of the fleet by installing fleet agents and creating MemberCluster API ([sample MemberCluster](./testfiles/member-cluster-2.yaml)) following [this document](https://github.com/Azure/fleet/blob/main/docs/howtos/clusters.md).

```bash
kubectl get membercluster -l cluster-name=member-2
NAME       JOINED   AGE   MEMBER-AGENT-LAST-SEEN   NODE-COUNT   AVAILABLE-CPU   AVAILABLE-MEMORY
member-2   True     16h   38s                      2            1848m           10318332Ki
```

### Validate the clusterResourcePlacement

To validate whether the resources are applied to the Member Cluster 2, you can check the status of the CRP object.

```bash
kubectl get crp crp-multi-cluster-app -o yaml
apiVersion: placement.kubernetes-fleet.io/v1
kind: ClusterResourcePlacement
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |

### Validate the trafficManagerEndpoint

To validate whether the service of Member Cluster 2 is exposed via Traffic Manager, you can check the status of the TrafficManagerBackend object.

```bash
kubectl get tmb nginx-backend -n multi-cluster-app -o yaml
apiVersion: networking.fleet.azure.com/v1alpha1
kind: TrafficManagerBackend
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {"apiVersion":"networking.fleet.azure.com/v1alpha1","kind":"TrafficManagerBackend","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"nginx-backend","namespace":"multi-cluster-app"},"spec":{"backend":{"name":"nginx-service"},"profile":{"name":"nginx-profile"},"weight":100}}
  creationTimestamp: "2024-11-25T08:49:09Z"
  finalizers:
  - networking.fleet.azure.com/traffic-manager-backend-cleanup

  uid: 90089f42-222a-4d9a-8a97-8b5ed2f9ca42
spec:
  backend:
    name: nginx-service
  profile:
    name: nginx-profile
  weight: 100
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2024-11-25T09:02:56Z"
    message: 2 service(s) exported from clusters have been accepted as Traffic Manager
      endpoints
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Accepted
    status: "True"
    type: Accepted
  endpoints:
  - cluster:
      cluster: member-1
    name: fleet-90089f42-222a-4d9a-8a97-8b5ed2f9ca42#nginx-service#member-1
    target: fleet-multi-cluster-app-member-1.westcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com
    weight: 50
  - cluster:
      cluster: member-2
    name: fleet-90089f42-222a-4d9a-8a97-8b5ed2f9ca42#nginx-service#member-2
    target: fleet-multi-cluster-app-member-2.westcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com
    weight: 50
```
Summary:
* The traffic is now split between the two clusters, member-1 and member-2, with a weight of 50% each.
* Similarly, when the cluster is left from the fleet by deleting memberCluster CR, all the placed resources excluding the fleet 
networking resources, will be left on the cluster, and the exported service will be removed from the Azure Traffic Manager automatically.

## Automatic Fail Over When One cluster Is Unhealthy

[Azure Traffic Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview) includes built-in endpoint monitoring and automatic endpoint failover. If one of the clusters goes down, 
Traffic Manager will automatically direct the new connections to the healthy cluster.

> Note:
> Because Traffic Manager works at the DNS level, it cannot influence existing connections to any endpoint. 
> When it directs traffic between endpoints (either by changed profile settings, or during failover or failback), 
> Traffic Manager directs new connections to available endpoints. Other endpoints might continue to receive traffic via 
> existing connections until those sessions are terminated. To enable traffic to drain from existing connections, applications 
> should limit the session duration used with each endpoint.

## Conclusion
This tutorial demonstrated how to build a multi-cluster applications seamlessly by using
clusterResourcePlacement, resourceOverrides, serviceExport, trafficManagerProfile and trafficManagerBackend APIs.
The traffic will be automatically split between the clusters and failover to the healthy cluster when one of the clusters is unhealthy.
