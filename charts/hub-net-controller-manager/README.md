## Override Azure cloud config

**If AzureTrafficManager feature is enabled, then an Azure cloud configuration is required.** Azure cloud configuration provides resource metadata and credentials for `fleet-hub-net-controller-manager` and `fleet-member-net-controller-manager` to manipulate Azure resources. It's embedded into a Kubernetes secret and mounted to the pods. The values can be modified under `config.azureCloudConfig` section in values.yaml or can be provided as a separate file.

You can create a file `azure.yaml` with the following content, and pass it to `helm install` command: `helm install <release-name> <chart-name> --set enableTrafficManagerFeature=true -f azure.yaml`

```yaml
config:
  azureCloudConfig:
    cloud: "AzurePublicCloud"
    tenantId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    subscriptionId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

    userAssignedIdentityID: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    aadClientId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    aadClientSecret: "<your secret>"
    userAgent: "fleet-hub-net-controller-controller"
    resourceGroup: "<resource group name>"
    location: "<resource group location>"
