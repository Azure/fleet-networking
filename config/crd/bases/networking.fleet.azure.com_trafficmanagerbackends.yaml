          TrafficManagerBackend is used to manage the Azure Traffic Manager Endpoints using cloud native way.
          A backend contains one or more endpoints. Therefore, the controller may create multiple endpoints under the Traffic
          Manager Profile.

                  The total weight of endpoints behind the serviceImport when using the 'Weighted' traffic routing method.
                  Possible values are from 0 to 1000.
                  By default, the routing method is 'Weighted'.
                  If weight is set to 0, all the endpoints behind the serviceImport will be removed from the profile.
                  The actual weight of each endpoint is the ceiling value of a number computed as weight/(sum of all weights behind the serviceImport)
                  * weight of serviceExport.
                  For example, if the weight is 500 and there are two serviceExports from cluster-1 (weight: 100) and cluster-2 (weight: 200)
                  behind serviceImport.
                  As a result, two endpoints will be created.
                  The weight of endpoint from cluster-1 is 100/(100+200)*500 = 167, and the weight of cluster-2 is 200/(100+200)*500 = 334.
                  There may be slight deviations from the exact proportions defined in the serviceExports due to ceiling calculations.
